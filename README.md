# wise

I'm reproducing Wise app, I'm using GetX for state management, dependency injection, and route management. This app is a little more complex than the previous one. There are still some pages to be completed. For the next following days i will build more pages and create the repository folders.

Obs : The first 4 images are the Splash page, and the other 3 is only one page with a slider for the images 

TECHNOLOGY USED
